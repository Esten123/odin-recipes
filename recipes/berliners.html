    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A Chilean Berliner pastry, known as "Berlines" in Chile, is a delightful and popular treat in Chilean cuisine. It is a type of filled doughnut that is typically round and fried to a golden brown perfection. The outer layer is soft and slightly crispy, creating a delicious contrast with the sweet filling inside.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Filling of your choice: Dulce de leche, fruit jam, chocolate, or pastry cream.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine warm milk, sugar, and active dry yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the yeast is activated and the mixture becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture, eggs, and softened butter.</li>
        <li>Mix the ingredients together until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes or until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough and roll it out on a floured surface to about 1/2-inch thickness. Use a round cutter to cut out doughnut shapes.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or a large, deep pan to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Fry the doughnuts for 2-3 minutes per side or until they are golden brown. Ensure they are cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove the fried doughnuts and let them cool on paper towels to absorb excess oil.</li>
        <li>Once the doughnuts are cool, fill them with your preferred filling using a piping bag or another suitable method.</li>
        <li>Dust the filled Berliners with powdered sugar for a finishing touch.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy your homemade Chilean Berliner pastries!</li>

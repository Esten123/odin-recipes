    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A Chilean completo is a type of hot dog that is popular in Chile. It's known for being a fully loaded and elaborate version of a hot dog, often considered a Chilean street food delicacy. The completo typically consists of a sausage (similar to a frankfurter or hot dog) served in a soft bread roll called a "marraqueta."
        What sets the completo apart is its wide array of toppings. A traditional completo is generously topped with ingredients such as diced tomatoes, mashed avocado, sauerkraut, mayonnaise, and sometimes mustard. Some variations may also include chopped onions, ketchup, and other condiments.</p>
